# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio site built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid)
- Javascript (Vanilla)
- Netify (hosting)

## Features

- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Dark mode toggle switch (with icon change)
- Contact form with validation and email submission (Formspree)
- DOM elements are created dynamically using both 'innerHTML'(template literal) and 'appendChild'(node-bsaed injection) depending on context

## Future Updates

- Will focus on adding real projects instead of template
