# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio site built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid)
- Javascript (Vanilla)
- Netify (hosting)

## Performance Optimisation

- Debouncing is applied to the portfolio to prevent excessive scrolling
- Event delegation is used to minimise the number of event listeners

## Features

- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Smooth scroll navigation
- Section snapping with scroll animation
- Dark mode toggle switch (with icon change)
- Contact form with validation and email submission (Formspree)

## Future Updates

- Will focus on adding real projects instead of template

## Live Demo
